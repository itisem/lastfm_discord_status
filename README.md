# Last.fm Discord Status 

A simple script to display your currently playing song from Last.fm as your Discord status. As things stand, it's an extremely simple version that may occasionally break, and has no UI, but it should be more or less usable :) I'll obviously try to make it better as I go along though.

You need the `pypresence` and `pylast` modules installed, then run `lastfm_discord_status.py`, which should guide you through all the settings.
